## Using capnography for respiratory monitoring during sedation can provide an extra layer of safety  {.center}

## The Canadian Anesthesiologists’ Society’s position statement recommends that capnography should be available wherever moderate or deep sedation is used. {.center}

## Capnography is a very sensitive device so we need to ensure the alarm conditions set will not disrupt procedures unnecessarily {.center}

## Every alarm that gets triggered from a capnography monitor during a procedure should be important enough to trigger an intervention {.center}

## The intervention should be initiated as soon as possible after the alarm is triggered {.center}

## Establishment period

- Start using the Capnostream 35p devices
- Comprehensive education to nursing staff
- Invited nurses to take part in the randomized controlled trial


## Stability period

### Goal was to optimize the alarm conditions

Audit and [feedback](https://capnofeedback.gatsbyjs.io) process to evaluate the performance characteristics of the capnography alarms:

- Alarm burden (total number of alarms triggered).
- Number of appropriate alarms (defined as an alarm that triggered an intervention).
- Number of inappropriate alarms (defined as alarms that were triggered but manually dismissed by silencing the alarm).
- Duration of alert conditions (defined as the total time that an alert condition was active).

## Audit and feedback processes are commonly used and can improve practice. {.center}

## Evaluation period

Alarm performance was compared between nurses randomized to use IPI with those who were not.

- Number of seconds in an alert condition state without an intervention being applied.
- Alarm burden (total number of alarms).
- Number of appropriate alarms.
- Number of inappropriate alarms.
- Total duration of alert conditions (inclusive of the time to an intervention *and* the time until the alert conditions are resolved).

## Primary outcome {.smaller}

### Number of seconds in an alert condition state without an intervention being applied

- Scored as zero if a patient did not have any alarms during the procedure
- Used a mixed effects model that accounted for the large number of zero scores, being the zero-inflated negative binomial mixed effects model
- The two parts of the zero-inflated model we used were a logit model to model which of the two processes the zero outcome was associated with, and a negative binomial model for the count process
- Fixed effect in the model was the randomization and the random effect was the cluster

## Secondary outcomes {.smaller}

- Alarm burden (total number of Medtronic Capnostream 35p monitor alarms).
- Number of appropriate alarms (defined as an alarm that triggered an intervention).
- Number of inappropriate alarms (defined as alarms that were triggered but manually dismissed by silencing the alarm).
- Total duration of alert conditions (defined as the total time that an alert condition was active inclusive of the time to an intervention and the time until the alert conditions are resolved).
- TROOPS adverse sedation events.
- Area under the curve of oxygen desaturation, calculated by taking the difference between a threshold (SpO2 90%) and current oxygen saturation summed each second while oxygen saturation was below the threshold.

## Area under the SpO~2~ 90% curve

### Lower for the IPI-enabled group (𝛽 `r zinb_nb_effects_spo2_auc[4]`; 95% CI `r zinb_nb_effects_spo2_auc[2]` to `r zinb_nb_effects_spo2_auc[6]`)

![](spo2.svg){.quarto-figure-center}

## Adverse events {.smaller}

- There was one intermediate severity respiratory adverse event observed in the IPI disabled group.
- There were two intermediate-severity adverse events related to sedation quality in the IPI enabled group.
- The remaining 13 adverse events were minor severity related to breathing where oxygen desaturation was addressed with minor interventions.
- There were no serious adverse events observed in either group.
- The odds ratio for the occurrence of an adverse event in the IPI enabled group compared to the IPI disabled group was `r adverse_events_model$Coefficient[2]` (95% CI `r adverse_events_model$CI_low[2]` to `r adverse_events_model$CI_high[2]`).

# Discussion <i class="fad fa-lightbulb-exclamation"></i> {background-color="#2196f3"}

## We found that the use of the Integrated Patient Index did not reduce the number of seconds that alarms were triggered without intervention. {.center}

### Therefore, results from the study do not indicate that integrating multiple physiological parameters related to respiratory assessment into a single index help to lower the threshold for intervention by nurses.

## Although we didn't specify thresholds in the protocol, nurses did not change alarm settings during the evaluation period. {.center}

### In effect, this was a comparison of IPI at a threshold of 4 versus no IPI. It is possible that results would differ at a lower IPI threshold.

## Although oxygen desaturation was not common in either group, the IPI-enabled group had lower levels of the area under the SpO~2~ desaturation curve {.center}

### It is possible that the actions taken in response to alarms in the IPI-enabled group mediated the effect on oxygen saturation, which potentially signals a safety benefit for using this approach for capnography alarm management

## The total doses of sedative and analgesic medication for many patients was small (median 1mg midazolam and 50-75mcg fentanyl) {.center}

###  May not be relevant to situations where higher doses of sedative and analgesic medication are used (higher number of alarms)

## The cluster design (by nurses) was a very efficient way to conduct this study {.center}

### Only possible due to the hybrid implementation-effectiveness design

## Further exploratory analyses are possible with the data collected in this study {.center}

## Limitations

- There was a smaller number of clusters included than we had planned due to the restricted number of sites available at the time of data collection.
- The intra-cluster correlation for the primary outcome was also higher (0.03) than we estimated for the sample size calculation.
- It is therefore possible that the final sample size for this study was too small to detect a statistically significant difference between groups for the primary outcome.
- The research assistant performing outcome measurement was not blinded to the allocation of the nurse because it was not practical to obscure the Capnostream monitor from their view without also impeding the nurses own use of the device.

# Conclusion <i class="fad fa-clipboard-check"></i> {background-color="#2196f3"}

## Enabling the Integrated Pulmonary Index did not lower the time taken by nurses to intervene after an alarm was triggered by the Capnostream monitor {.center}

### Potential of improved safety with lower severity of oxygen desaturation in the IPI-enabled group
